# Crypto Radar AI Agent: Solo Builder Roles

This project is shipped by one person wearing four hats to deliver a complete hackathon submission.

## Roles covered
- **Frontend engineer:** Built the Next.js App Router UI (chat, alerts sidebar, wallet connect, quick actions).
- **Backend/Agent engineer:** Implemented the `/api/agent` route with tool calling logic for price fetches, on-chain reads, and alert creation.
- **Smart contract engineer:** Delivered the Foundry contract, tests, and deploy script for the price alert registry.
- **Product manager:** Defined scope, demo flow, and the operational plan in README + HEARTBEAT.

## Project scope
- Chat with an AI agent to get prices, create alerts, and list alerts.
- On-chain alert registry deployed on Avalanche Fuji.
- Minimal, shippable UI focused on the core demo path.
